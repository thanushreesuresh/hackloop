# Chali Meter üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Hackloop


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Thanushree Suresh - Sahrdaya College of Engineering and Technology
- Member 2: Rosna P R - Sahrdaya College of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
Our website lets users enter their lamest Malayalam jokes and tells them how many seconds it made us laugh a fun way to measure their chali (lame) factor. It also shows an improvement graph to track your joke progress, recommends courses to level up your joke game, and features a Shelley-wise matcher where two users input their jokes to get a percentage score of their vibe matching!vv

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Nobody has a proper way to measure how lame their jokes are, track if they‚Äôre improving, or see how well their cringe humor vibes with others. The world is missing a chali compatibility and growth tracker!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The ‚ÄúChali Meter‚Äù app uses AI and random numbers to rate your joke, roast you (gently, or not), and then flashes a sticker to soften the blow. Every joke gets a random score and simulated laugh time‚Äîno one asked for this much fun, but we're serving it anyway!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
Here are the main technologies used in the Chali Meter project:

1. **Python** ‚Äì The primary programming language for backend logic.
2. **Flask** ‚Äì Web framework powering the backend and routing for the web app.
3. **Google Gemini AI (gemini-1.5-flash)** ‚Äì For generating roasts, joke ratings, and fun AI responses.
4. **HTML/CSS** ‚Äì For structuring and styling the web pages (including forms and stickers).
5. **JavaScript (optional)** ‚Äì Can be used for enhancing UI interactions, though not shown in the provided code.
6. **Random & OS Modules (Python)** ‚Äì Used for randomness (scores, laugh times, vibe match) and managing file paths for stickers.
7. **Templates** ‚Äì Flask‚Äôs Jinja2 templates (HTML files) for rendering dynamic content.

**Summary**: Flask (Python), Gemini AI, HTML/CSS (styling), random logic, and static assets (stickers) together make Chali Meter work!

## **Implementation (Short Version)**

**Install:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install Flask google-generativeai
```
- Add your Gemini API key in `app.py`.
- Create `templates/` for HTML files and `static/stickers/` for images.

**Run:**
```bash
python app.py
```
